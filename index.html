How Club Penguin Ruined My Winter Break
<p>When I was little, my family had a laptop that was older than me.</p>
<p>One day, I discovered a website called Club Penguin.</p>
<p>The laptop would get really hot when playing that game, but i kept going on it anyways.</p>
<p>During a winter break I had a friend over and I really wanted her to play Club Penguin with me.</p>
<p>While we were playing, the laptop suddenly froze!</p>
<p>No matter what we tried, the screen wasn't moving.</p>
<p>My mom was angry at first, but decided that we needed a new computer anyways.</p>
<p>But, I decided never to play Club Penguin again...</p>
